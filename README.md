# git-repo-tracker

A fast, cross-platform **system-tray app that watches your local git repositories**.
It discovers repos under directories you configure, periodically checks how far
each branch is behind its `origin`, and surfaces the results in the menu bar plus
a searchable popover — inspired by [RepoZ](https://github.com/awaescher/RepoZ).

## Features

- **Discovery** — recursively finds every git repo under your roots. The walk is
  pruned (it stops at each repo and skips `node_modules`, `vendor`, …), so even
  large trees scan in a few milliseconds.
- **Behind tracking** — a background `git fetch` (working tree never touched)
  keeps remote-tracking refs current, then each repo reports how many **commits**
  and **lines** it is behind.
- **Instant startup** — last-known state is cached to disk and painted before any
  git runs, so the UI is never blank or laggy.
- **Search popover** — left-click the tray icon for a borderless popover with a
  search field and a virtualized list (sort by name / most-behind; filter all /
  updatable / dirty).
- **Inline detail** — click a repo to expand its path and the latest local/origin
  commit times; hover to reveal **pull** or **keep fresh**, plus **open**.
- **Update all** — one button fast-forwards every repo that's behind.
- **Keep fresh** — opt a synced repo into safe automatic fast-forward pulls when
  a later refresh finds remote commits.
- **In-app settings** — manage roots, intervals, the open action, and
  launch-at-login without hand-editing YAML.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS)

```sh
brew install --cask laszukdawid/tap/git-repo-tracker
```

This drops **git-repo-tracker.app** into `/Applications`. It's a menu-bar
utility — no Dock icon and no main window — so after installing, **launch it once**:

- open it from **Launchpad** or **Spotlight** (⌘-Space → type "git-repo-tracker"), or
- run `open -a git-repo-tracker` in a terminal.

Its icon then appears in the menu bar (top-right). **Left-click** it for the
search popover, **right-click** for the menu. You don't need to keep a terminal
open — it keeps running in the background on its own.

To have it start automatically at login, turn on **Launch at login** in
**Settings** (open the popover, click **☰**). Then you never have to launch it by
hand again.

The cask strips the Gatekeeper quarantine flag on install, so the unsigned app
opens without an "unidentified developer" prompt (no Apple notarization needed).

### From source

Requires **Go 1.26+** and `git` on your `PATH`. On Debian/Ubuntu install the Fyne
build dependencies first with `task linux-deps`.

```sh
build/build.sh  # build; on macOS also rebuild and install the .app
task build     # same command, if Task is installed
task run       # build, then open the installed app on macOS
```

On macOS, each local build creates `dist/git-repo-tracker.app`, signs it for
local use, and replaces `/Applications/git-repo-tracker.app`. `task bundle` and
`task app-build-local` use the same build-and-install workflow. The installation
path stays stable for Login Items. A failed build, signature check, or copy keeps
the previous installed app; a failed replacement restores it.

Builds do not quit or relaunch a running app. Quit and reopen it to use the new
version. To install elsewhere, set `GIT_REPO_TRACKER_INSTALL_DIR`, for example:

```sh
GIT_REPO_TRACKER_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/Applications" build/build.sh
```

If you change that directory, enable **Launch at login** from the new installed
copy to update its startup path. Raw `go build` and `go test` remain compilation
and test commands; they do not install the app. On Linux, `build/build.sh` only
builds the binary.

Headless/status CLI:

```sh
go run ./cmd/git-repo-tracker-cli status --json
go run ./cmd/git-repo-tracker-cli status --refresh --json
```

## Usage

The app lives in the menu bar / system tray — it has no main window.

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Left-click** the tray icon | Open/close the search popover |
| **Right-click** the tray icon | Native menu. Linux shows outdated repos plus **Open App**. |
| Type in the search box | Live-filter by name or branch |
| **Click a repo row** | Expand inline detail (path + latest commit times) |
| **Hover a row** | Reveal **⬇ pull** when behind or **↻ keep fresh** when synced, plus **📂 open** |
| **⬇ in the header** | Update all — pull every repo that's behind |
| **☰ in the header** | Sort / filter / Settings |
| `Esc` | Dismiss the popover |

### Status notation

`↑n` ahead · `↓n` behind · `≡` even with upstream · `+n` staged · `~n` modified ·
`-n` deleted · `?n` untracked · `Δ+a/-d` lines behind · `⚠` last fetch/status error.

## Configuration

Config is YAML, hand-editable, and editable in-app via **Settings**. It lives at
`~/Library/Application Support/git-repo-tracker/config.yaml` (macOS) or
`~/.config/git-repo-tracker/config.yaml` (Linux); on first launch a starter file
is written (seeded with `~/projects` if it exists).

See **[docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)** for the full reference

## Notes & limitations

- **Translucency** — stock Fyne can't make a window truly see-through, so the
  "glass" look is a dark gradient rather than OS vibrancy. An experimental
  `NSVisualEffectView` blur is available behind `GRT_VIBRANCY=1` (macOS only).
- **Popover position** — anchors under the cursor at the top of the screen on
  macOS (Fyne/systray don't expose the tray icon's exact position). On
  Linux/Wayland, placement is left to the compositor.
- **Linux native tray** — AppIndicator menus are intentionally simple: they show
  outdated repos and **Open App**. Rich search, settings and inline detail live in
  the app window or optional GNOME Shell integration.
- **Click-away dismiss** — works on macOS (app-deactivation observer); on
  Linux/Windows use `Esc` or click the tray icon again.
